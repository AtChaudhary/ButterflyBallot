Analysis of Voting Patterns: 1996 Perot and 2000 Buchanan
This project explores the correlation between votes for Ross Perot in 1996 and votes for Pat Buchanan in 2000, focusing on county-level data. The hypothesis is that voters who supported Perot in 1996 were likely to vote for Buchanan in 2000, albeit with some variation.

Key Findings
Correlation Analysis: A scatter plot reveals a positive correlation between the votes for Perot in 1996 and Buchanan in 2000 across counties.

Regression Analysis: By running a regression of 1996 Perot votes to predict 2000 Buchanan votes, it was found that the predicted votes were significantly lower than the actual votes counted in some counties.

Butterfly Ballot Issue: The analysis highlights the case of Palm Beach County, Florida, which was pivotal in the 2000 election. The county's confusing "butterfly ballot" may have led to unintended votes for Buchanan when voters intended to select Al Gore.

Statistical Significance: The discrepancies observed in Palm Beach County were statistically significant through hypothesis testing, suggesting that the ballot design could have affected the election outcome.

This project aims to provide insights into how ballot design can impact voter behavior and election results, especially in closely contested areas.
